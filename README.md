# Agent

This repository contains the source code of the Eleven agent. 

The Eleven agent is installed in the instance running your sandbox during its creation (most of the time via `cloud-init` but it may vary depending on the cloud provider used).

The main role of this agent is to enable communication between your sandboxes, the [CLI](https://github.com/eleven-sh/cli) and your code editor.
